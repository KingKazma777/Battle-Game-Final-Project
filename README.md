# Battle-Game-Final-Project
For class CIS110. 
This is a simple turn-based battle game written in Python as part of my final project. The player chooses between actions like attack, defend, or heal while facing off against a computer opponent. The game runs entirely in the console and is meant to demonstrate beginner-level Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions. It's a basic but complete project designed to show what Iâ€™ve learned and keep the code easy to understand.
